<p>We will be organizing our first 12-hour physical hackathon dedicated to our well known event, the Ada
    Lovelace day. This hackathon will be focusing on gender minorities and how tech can be used to overcome
    some of their challenges. People of all genders will be encouraged to apply and we aim to create a safe
    and fair environment for participants to innovate. Participant and Mentor forms are now available on the
    website!</p>
