<p>For the first time, we will be organizing a 48-hour hackathon to replace our well known event, the Ada Lovelace 
  day Conference. This hackathon will be focusing on gender minorities and how tech can be used to overcome some 
  of their challenges. People of all genders will be encouraged to apply and we aim to create a safe and fair 
  environment for participants to innovate. </p>
