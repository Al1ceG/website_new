    For the first time, we organized a 48-hour hackathon to replace our well known event, the Ada Lovelace
    day Conference. This hackathon focused on gender minorities and how tech can be used to overcome some
    of their challenges. People of all genders were be encouraged to apply and we aimed to create a safe and fair
    environment for participants to innovate.
