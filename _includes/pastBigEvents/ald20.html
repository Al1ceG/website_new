    The aim of this international celebration is to help people learn about the achievements of women in STEM,
    encourage and inspire others and to create role models for all ages. Throughout the day we held talks from people
    of various backgrounds including Jasmina Lazic, Chief Data Technologist at the Universityâ€™s Bayes Centre and
    Ursula Martin.
