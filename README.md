# Hoppers new website 

<!-- Tasks: 
- Julia: home page
- Aparna: footer of contacts plus animations
- Sraddheya: events page
- Ioana: teams (meet the team + about us), sponsorship page -->

Some tips to keep format consistent everywhere - 
- In CSS, comment what page that section of code is for, and keep all global styles on the top of the document (can also look into splitting into multiple stylesheets - like one for events, one for home, etc.) 
- HTML: Indent code properly (let's use tabs?). Also, please use good, well explained names for classes/id, use newline after a tag of a big block of code, but for single line paras or links, same line is okay?
```
    <div>
      <a>Hello</a>
    </div>
 ```
